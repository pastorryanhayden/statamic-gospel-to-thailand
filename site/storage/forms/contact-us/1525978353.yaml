  Hello! I'm Jeffrey, a web developer and business optimizer that works at home, and I'm looking for new projects with clients who are in need of some awesome changes to their sites.
  
  I was just looking at your site and you have already have some good elements on it, but I can make it stronger and better and help you make more money out of it.  My overall goal isn't just to build websites, but to help my clients achieve their goals for their businesses. Would you be interested in getting a consultation?
  
  Let me know if you'd like a consultation or proposal (or both).  I'd really love to work on your site.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks!
