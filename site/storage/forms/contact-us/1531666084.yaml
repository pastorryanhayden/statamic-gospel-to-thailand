  I'm reaching out because I am a veteran web designer looking for new clients.  Your site has a TON of potential (not that it's bad now, but I can make it amazing). I'd like to give you a run down of exactly what I could do to enhance and increase its performance so that it'll be everything it can be.
  I am a business builder that focuses on making the site effective, not just attractive.  I am able to help my clients increase their sales from their site through the things I do with their sites.
  I'd really love to work on your site.  Let me know if you'd be interested in seeing some samples of my work and learning more.  Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks!
