  Hello,
  
  I was wondering if you're open to try some new ideas that can help your business grow. Imagine if navigating on your site was so much easier, aesthetically pleasing, and appealing to potential clients, offering a great experience to people while they easily discover what they are searching for. It would definitely lead to a substantial boost in your sales. It can be achieved, and I can definitely help you get there!
  
  Modern web user-interface with features that can automate business processes can make it a lot easier to run the business. It also leaves a good impression to your potential or returning clients, so they keep coming back for your products and services. If you are interested, I can send you my portfolio of work ready to be viewed so you'd be more familiar with how I can help you. You don't have to worry about my rates since they're considered affordable even for small businesses.
  
  If you have some free time in the next few days, I can also give you a consultation (for free!) to share some expert design ideas and to know about your ideas a well if you have any. Please reply about when's the best time to contact you. Talk soon!
  
  Best regards,
