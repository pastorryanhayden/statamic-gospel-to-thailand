  Hello,
  
  Most consumers are more comfortable finding products and services on websites that are easy to navigate, and most importantly good looking. After all, the appearance of your website can affect the credibility of your business from a consumer's point of view. Consider the redesign an investment although it doesn't have to cost a lot to get something aesthetically pleasing and attractive from a consumer perspective, and to make your website do functions that help run your business.
  
  I like the content you've got on your website but we could do a little bit of work with it. An upgrade on how your website looks can make a positive change for the benefit of your business.
  
  My proposal to you is a free consultation so that I could give you all the necessary information about how modern websites help businesses grow. I'll also be glad to show you my work with other clients I've had in the past 5 years. You'll be surprised of their positive feedback and how the new look of their website gave more profit to their business.
  
  Just let me know when we can contact you, so we can get started!
  
  
  Sincerely,
  Tracy Edmunds
