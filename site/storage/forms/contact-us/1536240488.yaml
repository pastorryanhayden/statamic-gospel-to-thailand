  Hi!
  
  I hope this message reaches you at a good time. I am writing to you because I was reviewing your website and noticed a lot of errors. I know this because I specialize in Web developing and design. Your website is not compatible for all platforms and there some bad links that are pointing towards your site. If you want, I can help you re-build and re-design your site to a more modern one. It will be accessible and easy to use for you and your visitors.
  
  You can check out the previous work that I have completed for previous clients and their feedback. I am a hardworking and trustworthy kind of person. My rates of services are fair and affordable but deliver quality results. If you have the time, I will love to discuss more about this with you in detail. Please don't hesitate to let me know and if you will be so kind as to leave your contact details. I will get back to shortly afterward. I look forward to working with you in the future.
  
  Thank you for your time.
