  Good day!
  
  Most people on the internet have such short attention spans and they will quickly leave a site that doesn't capture their attention; and that's where great design comes in to help. Imagine if navigating on your business website was effortless, aesthetically pleasing, and offers a great experience to people while they easily find what they are searching for. It would appeal to more potential and returning clients.
  
  As a freelance creative web developer for more than a decade now years now, I can tell when a site has incredible potential to become better. That's why I sent you this message. I'd like to be of assistance in making your website more functional and sales efficient. I've compiled a portfolio of my best work ready to be viewed, and if you're interested, I can send them right away. My services are cheap even for small businesses.
  
  I will also give you a free consultation over the phone, so I can give you expert design advice, and share with you my ideas. If you would like to know more about the work I do, kindly write back about when's the best time to contact you. Talk to you soon!
  
  Best regards,
