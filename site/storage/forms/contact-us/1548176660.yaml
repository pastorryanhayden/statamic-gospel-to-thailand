  Hi!
  
  I was just examining your website, and it seems you might have to update it to keep up with the current trends. People nowadays are more comfortable browsing the internet on their phone or tablet since it's more convenient. There were some issues when I was viewing it in mobile platforms, I can fix that for you. Also, I already like its design and overall user-interface, and I believe that your website can get even better so that your potential clients can be more engaged to do business with you, thus making your site more profitable.
  
  My rates are cheap since I'm committed to helping small businesses. I'm all about flexibility and I'm sure that we can work out something to fit your needs. I'll answer all the questions you have for me during a free consultation over the phone. I'd also like to know your ideas for the website, so please reply with the best time for me to call and your preferred contact details. Talk soon!
