  Good day!
  
  I was running a few SEO reporting tools on your website, and the results showed there are keywords you're using that search engines aren't able to pick up. You might need some help in fixing these issues so that Google and the other search engines will be able to index you better. Your website is most likely losing some points in possibly ranking high on search engine results. For a cheap cost, I can fix that for you.
  
  If you're interested, I'll provide you with a free consultation and show you how this will be achieved and show you the substantial benefit it can give to your business one you start getting more traffic (therefore generating more sales).
  
  I'd really love to help you out on your website, so kindly write back to let me know when you're free to talk about this. I hope to speak with you soon.
  
  Thanks!
