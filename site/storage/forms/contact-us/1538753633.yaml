  I sent you this email because I am a talented web designer looking for new projects with clients who are planning to take their website to a new level. I was just looking at your site, and I noticed that it's nicely done, but I can make it look more amazing and perform more efficiently to improve your sales. Besides a new interface that's more user-friendly, there are also certain features that I can integrate to your website to make some business processes easier between you and your clients.
  
  I have a lot of ideas I'd like to share with you. I'm quite certain you have some ideas too and I'd like to know about them so I can make it possible for the betterment of your business. I have a portfolio of my past work that I'd like you to take a look at. My designs have improved the sales of my previous clients.
  
  Please inform me if you're interested in a free consultation so I can give you my expert advice and proposal. You won't have to worry about my rates because they're relatively cheap that even small businesses can afford them. I'd really love to work on your website. When's the best time to be in touch with you?
  
  Thanks!
