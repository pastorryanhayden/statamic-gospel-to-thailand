  The newer trends on web design are not just focused on beauty, but they also have features integrated with your business processes that make it easier to run your company and easier to get new clients. Modern websites have the ability to do just about anything you can imagine and there are usually pre-built modules for any additional things you want to incorporate.  Just like Apps in the App Store on your phone (&quot;There's an App for that&quot;).
  
  I am a talented web designer that can provide you with all of the features of a modern website, as well as a updated look and feel. I sent you this email to see if you need any help with your website.
  
  I am able to work with most of the major programming languages, website platforms, shopping carts, etc. but I specialize in one platform that is truly amazing called WordPress. Building your site on that platform gives you an incredible number of features and allows you to personally make changes to your site in a simple and easy manner.
  
  Just let me know if you're interested and we can take it from there. I would really love to hear some of your ideas for the site and provide you with a few of my own as well. Would you be interested in hearing more about what I can do? No pressure. If this is a good fit, then great, but if not, I totally understand. Talk to you soon!
