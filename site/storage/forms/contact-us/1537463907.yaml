  Hello,
  
  I found a few issues on your site that might need a little work to be done. It looks like your website could use some help with its rankings in the web searches. Have you ever had it optimized before?
  
  There are a few key elements that weren't set up properly with the right keywords to make it easy for Google or the other major search engines to find it. I'm quite sure you already know that most business now are found by their clients while they were searching online. If you're not on the top search results, there's a lot of business opportunities that you're missing out on.
  
  My proposal to you is a free consultation to show you where your website is right now in terms or ranking, and where I can take it further with the help of the right tools. My expertise is on search engine optimization and the goal of this is to put businesses like you on the front page of the internet to outshine other competitors.
  
  Just let me know when we can get started. I'm really looking forward to it.
  
  
  Sincerely,
  Katherine Stewart
